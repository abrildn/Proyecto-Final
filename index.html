                World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by
                Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the
                world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft
                III: The Frozen Throne.[3] The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of
                the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, World of Warcraft has had nine major
                expansion packs: The Burning Crusade (2007), Wrath of the Lich King (2008), Cataclysm (2010), Mists of
                Pandaria (2012), Warlords of Draenor (2014), Legion (2016), Battle for Azeroth (2018), Shadowlands
                (2020), and Dragonflight (2022). Three further expansions, The War Within (planned for 2024), Midnight,
                and The Last Titan, were announced in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game
                world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing
                quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players
                to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat,
                however, the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on
                character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them
                more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other
                game systems.

                World of Warcraft was a major critical and commercial success upon its original release in 2004 and
                quickly became the most popular MMORPG of all time, reaching a peak of 12 million subscribers in
                2010.[4] The game had over one hundred million registered accounts by 2014[5] and by 2017, had grossed
                over $9.23 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time.
                The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the greatest MMORPG of all time and one of the greatest
                video games of all time and has also been noted for its long lifespan, continuing to receive developer
                support and expansion packs over 15 years since its initial release.[6][7][8] In 2019, a vanilla version
                of the game titled World of Warcraft Classic was launched, allowing players to experience the base game
                before any of its expansions launched,[9][10] with versions of Classic for future expansions being
                released subsequently,[11][12] with minor changes.[13] In 2022, Blizzard and NetEase cancelled an
                unannounced World of Warcraft mobile spin-off game.[14]
